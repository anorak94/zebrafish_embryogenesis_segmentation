    "A common way to analyse a time series signal upon addition of noise is the QF of the signal. However QF is defined for large samples. In our case the signal has finite length. I calculate the QF of the signal W for cell index 30 at various levels of noise in the simulation. QF is calculated by taking the value of the frequency at which the maximum power is observed(red line) and then computing the power 3db below that and noting the frequency at which that happens. QF = (f_max/2*(f_max-freq_3))"

    "This is the QF plot of W with noise, we expect the QF to decay with the added noise however this doesnt happen there is also a lot of stochasticity in the QF vs noise plot. One reason could be that the QF is defined for large(infinite) time series, in our case, the time series is small (only 4000 samples) and even then after a certain point most of the entries are zeros. This what a sample W at cell index 30 looks like \n",

    "Another approach that is used for analysing finite time series is wavelet analysis. I plot the scaleogram for W at cell index 30. The plot shows that most power is concentrated at te beginning of the signal as we can see from the plot of W above. But the plot doesnt give us information about how the signal degrades with noise, because even the scaleogram of a GWN will have some features, to this end i include a significance test for the wavelet power spectrum, the null hypothesis is that the wavelet power value is only caused by randomness (i.e. a GWN). For a morlet wavelet the wavelet power value is distributed as $\\chi^2_2 $ distribution. I choose the value of $ p = 0.1$ for the significance value."

To distinguish them i carry out the significance test on the wavelet power density. Since the dimension of the scaleogram is len(scales) x len(time). I take the most significant scale at each noise level and plot that with noise. Multiple realizations are carried out at each noise level to provide a robust estimate of the most significant scale. Below is the plot of the p value at most significant scale for each noise level. "
